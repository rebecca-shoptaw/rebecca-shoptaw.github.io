## UI Walkthrough

The UI for the portfolio is quite straightforward and intuitive -- it's a single page site composed of a sticky nav bar (the `Nav` component), a welcome section, and three main info sections, each of which has its own componenet: `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact`.

The idea here was to make the site as seamless to navigate as possible: to have all the information readily available to the user via a quick scroll through, and to make jumping around easy by keeping the nav bar always in view.

## Implementation

### Component Structure

The site is designed using a nested component structure, so that each component is responsible for rendering only a single part of the site's UI.

The current organization of the components and sub-components is as follows:

```
Homepage
  -- Nav
  -- About
     -- BioSnippet
  -- Projects
     -- ProjectTile
  -- Contact
    -- SocialLink
```

The nested components (`BioSnippet`, `ProjectTile`, `SocialLink`) are each rendered via their parent components mapping over a separately-stored data array.

For example, the `Projects` component maps over the `projects` array of objects, of which each looks something like this:

```
 {
    id: `open-editions`,
    title: `Open Editions`,
    img_alt: `Audiobook playlist with romantic painting in the background.`,
    description: `A minimalist and aesthetically pleasing audiobook player, which combines public domain audiobook recordings of classic novels with customized cover images . Built with Typescript, React and the Librivox API.`,
    wip: true,
  },
```

As it does so, it passes each project object as a component to the `ProjectTile` sub-component, which then handles all the rendering:

```
{projects.map((project) => (
  <ProjectTile key={project.id} project={project} />
))}

```

### Custom Hooks

The site also uses a few custom hooks to avoid unnecessary repetitions in the code:

- `useReset` makes the simple URL reset function available to any component that needs it (such as to prevent anchor tags like "#about" from appearing in the URL)
- `useAnimation` handles all the GSAP imports and returns the intro animation function for easy use by the `Homepage` component

## Next Steps

- [x] Redo styling using SASS
- [x] Use meta and Schema.org tags to improve SEO
- [x] Reorganize app using custom hooks and sub-components
- [x] Use GSAP to create a fun intro animation
- [ ] Shift scroll animations from `react-awesome-reveal` to GSAP
- [ ] Add a test suite via Jest
